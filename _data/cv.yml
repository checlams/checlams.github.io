    - title: Ph.D., Chemical Engineering
      institution: Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana, USA
      year: 2018
      description:
        - Solved a longstanding problem in chemical engineering of developing a shortcut method for minimum reflux calculation for multicomponent distillation in multi-feed, multi-product columns
        - Developed the first enumeration-based global optimization algorithm to identify distillation configurations that can save up to 50% of total cost or total exergy loss compared to conventional schemes
        - For the first time, proposed a systematic multi-layer approach for process intensification in multicomponent distillation, offering industrial practitioners an easy-to-follow recipe to synthesize numerous new and intensified configurations that further enhance operability, improve efficiency, and reduce total costs
