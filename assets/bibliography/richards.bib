abstract = {Modeling and predicting soil moisture is essential for precision agriculture, smart irrigation, and drought prevention. In this work, we introduce a novel data-driven random walk (DRW) approach to solve $n$-dimensional Richards equation, a complex partial differential equation that characterizes water flow dynamics in soil. This advanced computational framework integrates multiple features, including finite volume discretization, adaptive L-scheme, multi-layer neural networks, and the concept of random walk to enable fast and accurate numerical solution of the Richards equation. Through an illustrative example, we demonstrate the accuracy and attractiveness of this novel approach. In particular, we show that our DRW approach can implicitly capture the underlying physical relationships among soil moisture content, pressure head, and flux, which will enable more accurate characterization of water flow dynamics.},
