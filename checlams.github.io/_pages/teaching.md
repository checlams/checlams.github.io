In **Fall 2023**, I taught *CHE 4124 - Chemical Engineering Design I* for the second time, with [Prof. Clint Aichele](https://ceat.okstate.edu/che/faculty-staff/clint-aichele.html). I received an overall teaching evaluation score of 4.4 out of 5. In the Phillips 66 Design Project competition, we explored ways to maximize ultra-low-sulur diesel production from the sweet gas oil to improve overall process economics of hydrotreating process.

In **Spring 2023**, I taught *CHE 3113 - Rate Operations II* for the second time. I received an overall teaching evaluation score of 4.38 out of 5 ("Excellent" rating) on end-of-semester course evaluation (response rate = 95%). 

In **Fall 2022**, I taught *CHE 2581 - Chemical Engineering Sophomore Seminar* with [Prof. Sundar Madihally](https://ceat.okstate.edu/che/faculty-staff/sundar-madihally.html). In this course, we invited industrial and faculty speakers to introduce the chemical engineering profession and different career paths chemical engineers can pursue to sophomores. We also organized and presented various useful resources at OSU (e.g., services in academic tutoring, career development, and mental health and wellness) to sophomore students, taught them practical skills (e.g., resume writing, lab report writing and formatting, career fair and interview prepraration), and introduced needed concepts and qualities for becoming a successful chemical engineer (e.g., engineering ethics, professionalism, chemical process safety). I received an overall teaching evaluation score of 4.71 out of 5 ("Excellent" rating) on end-of-semester course evaluation (response rate = 91%). 

In **Spring 2022**, I restructured and taught a brand new *CHE 3113 - Rate Operations II*. This was my first time teaching solo, and I revamped the course structure and materials to synergistically integrate it with chemical reaction engineering and senior design. I received an overall teaching evaluation score of 4.04 out of 5 ("Good" rating: 3.75-4.25) on end-of-semester course evaluation (response rate = 96%). I also presented a poster during the [2022 ASEE/AIChE Summer School for Engineering Faculty](https://www.aiche.org/conferences/faculty-chemical-engineering-summer-school/2022) to highlight this brand new structure and methodology to teach undergraduate separations course by helping students develop a systematic and comprehensive perspective on the subject matter.

In **Fall 2021**, I co-taught *CHE 4124 - Chemical Engineering Design I* along with [Prof. Josh Ramsey](https://ceat.okstate.edu/che/faculty-staff/josh-ramsey.html) and [Prof. Shohreh Hemmati](https://ceat.okstate.edu/che/faculty-staff/shohreh-hemmati.html). I received an overall score of 4.47 out of 5 ("Excellent" rating: >4.25/5) on end-of-semester course evaluation (response rate = 93%).
