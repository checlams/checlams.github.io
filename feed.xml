Many of these PDEs are highly nonlinear and very difficult to solve in practice. For example, the Richards equation, which captures irrigation, precipitation, evapotranspiration, runoff, and drainage mechanisms of water in porous medium such as soil, has the form:</p> \[\begin{align*} &amp;\partial_t\Theta(\psi)+\nabla \cdot \textbf{q} = 0,\\ &amp;\textbf{q} = -\textbf{K}(\Theta)\nabla (\psi+z) \end{align*}\] <p>In particular, variable \(\textbf{K}\) denotes the unsaturated hydraulic water conductivity expression and is a highly nonlinear function, making the Richrads equation challenging to solve. Most existing PDE solvers are based on discretization approaches such as finite difference, finite element, and finite volume. However, for finite difference and finite element methods, we observe that, upon discretization, the useful physical information associated with the transport phenomena of the PDEs is typically not preserved. On the other hand, FVM adopts an integral form of the PDE, thereby preserving some of the useful physical insights. Unfortunately, even if the PDE of interest is discretized using FVM, the discretized equations are usually transformed into a matrix equation and solved numerically. Again, this solution process loses the physical insights. Therefore, our goal is to enhance the quality and performance of the solution process by developing a novel computational framework that explores and utilizes the underlying physics behind the PDEs derived from transport phenomena.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="solution-strategy">Solution Strategy</h2> <p>To explore and incorporate additional useful physical insights to our algorithm, we introduce the concept of <strong>random walk</strong>, a stochastic process that describes the paths as \(N\) particles or molecules move in random steps, to the FVM framework to model the particles’ transport phenomena subject to external forces (e.g., gravity) and obstacles<d-cite key="song:2022:richards"></d-cite>. Such a concept has been used to solve partial differential equations with strong physical background, such as the heat<d-cite key="lawler2010random"></d-cite> and diffusion<d-cite key="sandev2018continuous"></d-cite> equations. In our case, we anticipate that the number of water molecules inside a unit volume of soil at any time is also a random process. With this, we can develop a systematic computational framework for solving the Richards equation effectively. Specifically, we use multi-layer neural network to learn a data-driven random walk model, which is then incorporated into a modified FVM scheme to obtain solutions of the Richards equation. Through an illustrative case study, we demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of our innovation solution framework and compare it with state-of-the-art numerical methods.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="fvm-based-discretization">FVM-based Discretization</h2> <p>FVM is a classic numerical method that incorporates conservation laws to allow volume integrals to be converted into surface integrals by applying the divergence theorem. Using the Richards equation as an example, we first integrate both sides of it to obtain the integral form of the Richards equation over a \(n+1\)-dimensional control volume \(V\). Next, we apply the divergence theorem to convert the volume integral into a \(n\)-dimensional surface integral after determining the outward pointing unit normal vector $\textbf{n}$:</p> \[\int_V \partial_t\Theta(\psi)\mathbf{d}V=\int_V \nabla \cdot [\textbf{K}(\Theta)\nabla (\psi+z)]\mathbf{d}V\] <p>To adopt the FVM, we discretize the control volume \(V\) and its surface \(S_V\) into \(N_{\omega}\) small cells \(V_i\) with \(i=1,\cdots, N_\omega\), and small surfaces \(\omega\) with volume \(A_\omega\) with \(\omega=1,\cdots, N_\omega\), respectively. Now, we discretize the integral equation by denoting the discretized version of the operator \(\textbf{K}(\cdot)\nabla (\cdot)\) with respect to the small surface \(\omega\) as \([\textbf{K}(\cdot)\nabla (\cdot)]_\omega\).</p> <p>The RHS of the integral equation can be discretized by summing over \([\textbf{K}(\cdot)\nabla (\cdot)]_\omega\) for all \(\omega\):</p> \[\partial_t\Theta(\psi)\text{vol}(V_i)=\sum_{\omega=1}^{N_\omega} [\textbf{K}(\Theta)\nabla (\psi+z)]_\omega \cdot\textbf{n}_\omega A_\omega\] <p>To apply time stepping on the LHS of the integral equation, we discretize the time domain and approximate the time derivative \(\partial_t\Theta(\psi_i)\) as \(\frac{\Theta_i^{m+1,s+1}-\Theta_i^m}{\Delta t}\), where \(\Theta_i^{m+1,s+1}\) represents the discretized \(\Theta\) in the \(i\)-th small cell at time step \(m+1\) and iteration step \(s+1\), and \(\Theta_i^m\) is the converged \(\Theta\) value in the \(i\)-th small cell at the current time step \(m\). Overall, we have:</p> \[\frac{\Theta_i^{m+1,s+1}-\Theta_i^m}{\Delta t} \text{vol}(V_i)=\sum_{\omega=1}^{N_\omega} [\textbf{K}(\Theta)\nabla (\psi+z)]_\omega \cdot\textbf{n}_\omega A_\omega\] <p>After time stepping is complete, the conventional FVM practice typically writes and solves the discretized equations in matrix form. Due to the stiffness and sparsity of the resulting matrix, solving such a matrix equation is known to be computationally challenging. Therefore, we propose an alternative route that solves the discretized equations in an iterative manner using an adaptive L-scheme by adding the term \(L_i^{m+1,s}(\psi_i^{m+1,s+1}-\psi_i^{m+1,s})\) to the discretized LHS of the integral equation. This adaptive L-scheme extends the idea of standard static L-scheme<d-cite key="suciu2021global"></d-cite> by ensuring convergence of the L-scheme<d-cite key="song:2022:richards"></d-cite>.</p> <p>Overall, we obtain an adaptive linearized FVM numerical scheme that favors the preservation of physical information of the original PDE:</p> \[\begin{aligned} \psi_i^{m+1,s+1} =&amp; \frac{1}{L_i^{m+1,s}}\sum_{\omega=1}^{N_\omega} \textbf{K}_\omega^{m+1,s}\cdot\textbf{n}_\omega\frac{(\psi+z)_j^{m+1,s}-(\psi+z)_i^{m+1,s}}{d(j,i)}A_\omega\\&amp;-\frac{1}{L_i^{m+1,s}}\frac{\Theta_i^{m+1,s+1}-\Theta_i^m}{\Delta t}\text{vol}(V_i)+\psi_i^{m+1,s}. \end{aligned}\] <hr/> <h2 id="data-driven-random-walk-algorithm">Data-Driven Random Walk Algorithm</h2> <p>We further introduce a data-driven random walk (DRW) algorithm that will be integrated with the FVM scheme to solve the PDE. Compared to pure FVM-based approaches, the additional underlying physical knowledge implicitly learned by the DRW algorithm can be very useful in obtaining accurate solutions of the PDE. Let \(n_i^{m+1,s}\) be the number of particles in cell \(i\) at fixed-point iteration step \(s\) and time step $m+1$, and \(\delta n_{i,j}^{m+1,s}\) be the number of particles moved from cell \(i\) to cell \(j\) at iteration \(s\) and time step \(m+1\). Without loss of generality, let us consider the 1-dimensional case of the Richards equation in which the number of water molecules in cell \(i\) follows:</p> \[n_i^{m+1,s}=\delta n_{i,i}^{m+1,s}+\delta n_{i+1,i}^{m+1,s}+\delta n_{i-1,i}^{m+1,s}\] <p>We point out that the concept of random walk of particles has been adopted previously<d-cite key="vamos2001global"></d-cite> for solving the diffusion equation. However, we observe that directly using this random walk concept is insufficient, as the relationship between pressure head \(\psi_i\) and the number of particles \(n_i\) still remains unclear. Therefore, we suggest model the relationship using a multi-layer neural network (MNN), which are known to be possible given that the neural network contains enough neurons. MNN enables us to approximate \(\psi_i\) as a nonlinear function of \(n_i\), \(\psi_i=f(n_i)\), at any fixed time step and iteration step, which can be incorporated in the discretized equation to yield the following data-driven random walk (DRW) formulation:</p> \[\begin{aligned} n_i^{m+1,s+1} =&amp; \frac{1}{L_i^{m+1,s}}\sum_{\omega=1}^{N_\omega} \textbf{K}_\omega^{m+1,s}\cdot\textbf{n}_\omega\frac{n_j^{m+1,s}-n_i^{m+1,s}}{d(j,i)}A_\omega \\&amp;+ f^{-1}(\textbf{J}) +n_i^{m+1,s}, \end{aligned}\] <p>where \(\textbf{J}=\sum_{\omega=1}^{N_\omega} \textbf{K}_\omega^{m+1,s}\cdot\textbf{n}_\omega\frac{z_j^{m+1,s}-z_i^{m+1,s}}{d(j,i)}A_\omega-\frac{1}{L_i^{m+1,s}}\frac{\Theta_i^{m+1,s+1}-\Theta_i^m}{\Delta t}\text{vol}(V_i)\).</p> <hr/> <h2 id="drw-architecture">DRW Architecture</h2> <p>The figure below shows our DRW architecture for solving the Richards equation. Of course, such architecture can be generalized to other PDEs.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col mt-3 mt-md-0"> </div> <div class="col-10 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/img/publication_preview/drw_focapo.svg" alt="DRW architecture"/> </div> <div class="col mt-3 mt-md-0"> </div> </div> <p>During offline learning, we first obtain reference solutions from the global random walk solvers developed by <d-cite key="suciu2021global"></d-cite>. We also introduce Gaussian noise to these reference solutions to reflect the stochastic nature of the relationship between \(\Psi_i^s\) and \(n_i^s\) and improve the robustness of DRW algorithm by enhancing its generalization performance. Introducing Gaussian noise also improves the quality of solutions obtained, as the reference solutions themselves exhibit random error and are not strictly accurate. The noise-added reference solutions are used as training and validation sets to train two MNNs, namely MNN1 and MNN2. In MNN1, we learn \(f\) that maps the number of particle in a cell to the pressure head information, whereas in MNN2, we learn the inverse mapping \(f^{-1}\) from pressure head information to the number of particles. Once offline learning is complete, we proceed to the actual solution process, where the Richards equation to be solved is first discretized to the adaptive linearized FVM scheme. Then, the discretized form is sent to the DRW algorithm, where it passes through the inverse mapping \(f^{-1}\) learned from MNN2 to generate the solution of the Richards equation in terms of the particle distribution in each cell, \(n_i\). Finally, to convert this solution \(n_i\) to physically meaningful solutions such as pressure head $\Psi$, flux \(q\), and moisture content \(\Theta\), we apply the trained mapping \(f\).</p> <p>For more information about the numerical case study for illustrating the effectiveness of the DRW algorithm architecture, please refer to our recent publication<d-cite key="song:2022:richards"></d-cite>.</p>]]></content><author><name>Zheyu Jiang</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Facilitating numerical solution by incorporating physics]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">How to deploy your al-folio themed website to GitHub page for the first time?</title><link href="https://checlams.github.io/blog/2022/deployment/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How to deploy your al-folio themed website to GitHub page for the first time?"/><published>2022-10-21T15:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-10-21T15:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://checlams.github.io/blog/2022/deployment</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://checlams.github.io/blog/2022/deployment/"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio"><strong>al-folio</strong></a> is a simple, clean, and responsive <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll theme</a> for academics. It was developed and maintained by <a href="https://maruan.alshedivat.com">Maruan Al-Shedivat</a>. Starting version <a href="https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/releases/tag/v0.3.5">v0.3.5</a>, al-folio will automatically re-deploy webpage each time new changes are pushed to the repository. While this feature worked awesomely well in general, we did notice some small issues during our initial deployment of the CLAMS website. As we tried to figure out ways to resolve these issues, we noticed that we were not alone – many people had similar doubts/problems during the deployment of their websites, especially for those who do not have extensive background or experience in computer science, just like us. After we finally understood what was actually going on, we realized that most of the issues were due to the lack of step-by-step documentation for new users. This blog post highlights the key steps needed to successfully deploy your website powered by Jekyll with al-folio theme to GitHub for the first time. Therefore, this post mainly serves to fill the gap in documentation/instructions for new users.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="things-that-may-go-wrong-during-your-first-deployment">Things that may go wrong during your first deployment</h2> <p>After making changes to our code, you would follow the standard <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bundle</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll build</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code> commands (or simply <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bundle exec jekyll serve</code>) in your terminal to build the site and make it available on a local server. <strong>However, if you are using you are using Ruby version 3.0.0 or higher, this step <a href="https://github.com/github/pages-gem/issues/752">may fail</a> because <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/8523">Ruby 3.0.0 no longer comes with webrick</a>. Therefore, you need to add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">webrick</code> to your dependencies: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bundle add webrick</code> before proceeding to the next steps.</strong></p> <p>Now, everything looks great on our local host <a href="http://localhost:4000">http://localhost:4000</a>. Since you are aware of the automatic deployment feature added to versions <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v0.3.5</code> and newer, you think you just need to push the changes to GitHub (most probably to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code> branch), and GitHub should just automatically deploy your website. After all, everything works well locally, what else can happen? OOps! Most likely you will receive an error message like this:</p> <p align="center"><img src="/assets/img/blogpost/2022-10-21-blog1.png" width="750"/></p> <p>In fact, you are not the only one who had this issue (see <a href="https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/issues/529">here</a>, <a href="https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar/issues/194">here</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/issues/69">here</a> for issues related to ‘bibliography’, and <a href="https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar/issues/162">here</a> for an issue related to ‘cite’). Most fix suggestions deal with making sure that 1) <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">, group: :jekyll_plugins</code> is added next to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gem "jekyll-scholar"</code> line in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gemfile</code>, and 2) <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">plugins_dir: [jekyll-scholar]</code> is included in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code> file. However, for al-folio, these suggestions are not that helpful because these lines are already there. So what has exactly happened?</p> <p>As you probably notice already, these issues all point toward <a href="https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll-scholar</code></a>, which handles ‘bibliography’, ‘cite’, etc. As pointed out by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll-scholar</code> developer, for security reasons, GitHub Pages does not allow running arbitrary Ruby code in its build process. This means that it is not possible to use third-party Jekyll plugins at will, and only a restricted handful of selected Ruby gems can be loaded. Unfortunately, <a href="https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar">Jekyll-scholar is not among those</a>, <strong>so it is not possible to use it and at the same time rely on the automated GitHub Pages build system</strong> (see a similar discussion <a href="https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar/issues/163">here</a>).</p> <p>The solution to this issue is to <strong>type the script <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.bin/deploy</code> in terminal for deployment, which is THE key step of the entire deployment process</strong>. In this step, you will be asked for your GitHub username and password. However, if you directly type your GitHub password, you will encounter the following error message:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>remote: Support for password authentication was removed on August 13, 2021. Please use a personal access token instead.
fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://github.com/your-github-username/your-website-name.github.io.git/'
</code></pre></div></div> <p>As the message suggested, starting August 13, 2021, GitHub no longer accepts <em>account passwords</em> when authenticating Git operations on GitHub.com. Instead, <strong>token-based authentication (e.g., personal access, OAuth, SSH Key, or GitHub App installation token) will be required for all authenticated Git operations</strong>. To set up your personal token, you need to follow the instructions <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token">here</a>.</p> <p>Now you are almost done. You can type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.bin/deploy</code> in terminal and press enter/return. Hopefully, you will receive a “successful deployment” message. Now you try to load <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">your-website-name.github.io</code> in your favorite browser, but all you can see is a 404 error message that says “there isn’t a GitHub Pages site here”. For new users, this can be very confusing. After all, the page has been successfully deployed. The reason why you see an error is because you are currently in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code> branch. <strong>For deployment, you must set the branch to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gh-pages</code> branch in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Pages</code> section under the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Settings</code> of your repository</strong>. The details on how to configure a publishing source of your GitHub Pages site are discussed <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site">here</a>. Now everything should work!</p> <p align="center"><img src="/assets/img/blogpost/2022-10-21-blog2.png" width="750"/></p> <hr/> <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2> <p>In summary, to successfully deploy your website for the first time, you would need to do it by yourself by first creating your personal authentication token, typing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.bin/deploy</code>, and changing your branch to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gh-pages</code> instead of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code>. Fortunately, for later deployments, the automatic deployment feature will take effect and works great, and GitHub will automatically deploy your webiste whenever you push changes to GitHub.

Prof. Jiang obtained his BChE from the <a href="https://cse.umn.edu/cems">University of Minnesota</a> in 2014 and PhD from <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/ChE">Purdue University</a> in 2018.</p> <p>At OSU, Prof. Jiang will lead the Computational Laboratory for Advanced Manufacturing and Sustainability (CLAMS), where he will develop advanced process systems engineering methods and tools to solve some of the most critical challenges of our time, including separations, pharmaceutical manufacturing, digital agriculture, sustainability, Food-Energy-Water Nexus, and so on. Prof. Jiang has a broad interest in various fields of process systems engineering, such as mathematical modeling, process optimization and control, conceptual process synthesis and design, machine learning, and data analytics.</p> <p>In the near term, Prof. Jiang is committed to combining his expertise in process systems engineering and agriculture and specialty chemicals manufacturing (in particular, agrochemical manufacturing) to address various sustainability issues related to Food-Energy-Water-Climate Nexus:</p> <blockquote> <p>“By 2050, the global population is expected to reach 9.7 billion. Thus, the global food production must increase by at least 70% by 2050. Considering that current agriculture and food sectors are already one of the largest consumers of global water, energy, and land resources, the key question that is critical to the sustainable development of human society in the 21<sup>st</sup> century is the following - <strong>How can we massively increase crop production without putting additional stress on land, energy, and water resources while at the same time ensuring sustainability for all?</strong>”</p> </blockquote> <p>To address this grand challenge, CLAMS will work closely with experts in agronomy, biology, chemistry, chemical and environmental engineering, economics and finance, artificial intelligence, data science, and operations research to reexamine and renovate all human activities involved in the R&amp;D, production, distribution, processing, and consumption of agricultural products, thereby offering data-driven, systems-oriented solutions and insights to the sustainable intensification of global agriculture and food systems.
