I have been a graduate student in Prof. Jiang's CLAMS group since Spring 2022. Before that, I earned my M.Sc. degree in Mathematics from the [University of Macau](https://www.um.edu.mo/) and B.Sc. degrees in Statistics and Law from [Shandong University of Science and Technology](https://en.sdust.edu.cn/) in China. Currently, I am working on data-driven, physics-informed numerical methods for solving complex partial differential equations, with applications in precision agriculture. My CV can be found [here]({{ '/assets/pdf/CV/Zeyuan_Nov2021.pdf' | relative_url }}).

## Education

* M.Sc. -- University of Macau, Mathematics (2020-2022)
