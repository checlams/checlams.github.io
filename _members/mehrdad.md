I have been a graduate student in Prof. Jiang's CLAMS group since Spring 2023. I am also co-advised by [Prof. Yu Feng](https://ceat.okstate.edu/che/faculty-staff/yu-feng.html). Before that, I earned my M.Sc. degree in Mechanical Engineering from the [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en) in Iran. Currently, I am working on integrating computational fluid dynamics and machine learning to solve complex problems in advanced manufacturing and sustainability. My CV can be found [here]({{ '/assets/pdf/CV/Mehrdad_Jan23.pdf' | relative_url }}).
