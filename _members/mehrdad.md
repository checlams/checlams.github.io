I have been a graduate student in Prof. Jiang's CLAMS group since Spring 2023. I am also co-advised by [Prof. Yu Feng](https://ceat.okstate.edu/che/faculty-staff/yu-feng.html). Before that, I earned my M.Sc. degree in Mechanical Engineering from the [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en) in Iran. Currently, I am working on integrating computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and machine learning to explore optimal sensor placement strategy for fast, reliable leakage detection in chemical plants and oil and gas production wells. My CV can be found [here]({{ '/assets/pdf/CV/Mehrdad_Jan23.pdf' | relative_url }}).
