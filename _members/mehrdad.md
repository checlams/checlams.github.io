I was a CLAMS member from Spring 2023 to Summer 2024. I was also co-advised by [Prof. Yu Feng](https://ceat.okstate.edu/che/faculty-staff/yu-feng.html). Before that, I earned my M.Sc. degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Tehran in Iran. I'm now pursuing my PhD at Arizona State University.

## Education
* M.Sc. -- University of Tehran, Mechanical Engineering (2015-2018)
