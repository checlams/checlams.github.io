We are part of [School of Chemical Engineering](https://ceat.okstate.edu/che/) at [Oklahoma State University](https://go.okstate.edu/) (Go Pokes!), led by [Prof. Zheyu Jiang]({{ '/cv/' | relative_url }}). At CLAMS, we develop advanced computational theories, methods, and tools, as well as systems-oriented solutions and insights to address some of the greatest challenges of our times, such as in **Industrial Decarbonization**, **Advanced Manufacturing**, **Digital Agriculture**, and **Sustainability**. To learn more about what we do, feel free to [talk to us](mailto:zheyu.jiang@okstate.edu) or follow us on social media.

ðŸš€ **We have one fully-funded PhD opening for Spring 2026!** Please [check here]({{ '/assets/pdf/opening_25.pdf' | relative_url }}) for description of the position and instructions to apply.
