In Fall 2022, I am teaching *CHE 2581 - Chemical Engineering Sophomore Seminar* with [Prof. Sundar Madihally](https://ceat.okstate.edu/che/faculty-staff/sundar-madihally.html). In this course, we invite industrial and faculty speakers to introduce chemical engineering fundamentals and career development to sophomores.

In Spring 2022, I taught *CHE 3113 - Rate Operations II*. The syllabus for this course can be found [here]({{ 'assets/pdf/Course/CHE3113_Syllabus.pdf' | relative_url }}). This was my first time teaching solo, and I received an overall teaching evaluation score of 4.04 out of 5 ("Good" rating: 3.75-4.25) on end-of-semester course evaluation (response rate = 96%). Learning from students' feedback, I'm ready to improve my teaching the next time I teach Rate Ops II. I also presented a poster highlighting this brand new structure and approach to teach separation principles in a systematic and comprehensive manner during the 2022 ASEE/AIChE Summer School for Engineering Faculty.

In Fall 2021, I taught *CHE 4124 - Chemical Engineering Design I* along with [Prof. Josh Ramsey](https://ceat.okstate.edu/che/faculty-staff/josh-ramsey.html) and [Prof. Shohreh Hemmati](https://ceat.okstate.edu/che/faculty-staff/shohreh-hemmati.html). I received an overall score of 4.47 out of 5 ("Excellent" rating: >4.25/5) on end-of-semester course evaluation (response rate = 93%).
