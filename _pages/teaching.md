In **Fall 2025**, I am co-teaching _CHE 4124 - Chemical Engineering Design I_ with [Prof. Josh Ramsey](https://ceat.okstate.edu/che/faculty-staff/josh-ramsey.html) again. At the same time, I am excited to offer a new elective course _CHE 4990 - Modern Energy Systems Analysis_ for senior undergraduate and graduate students. Modern energy systems are rapidly evolving to address the challenges of sustainability, reliability, and efficiency. This course provides a gentle yet comprehensive introduction to the quantitative analysis of modern energy systems. Together, we will explore topics such as ongoing shifts in U.S. energy landscape, renewable energy integration, power grid optimization, industrial decarbonization, energy storage systems, decentralized energy markets, and more.

In **Spring 2025**, I taught _CHE 3113 - Rate Operations II_ for the fourth time. I received an overall teaching evaluation score of 4.62 out of 5 ("Excellent" rating) on end-of-semester course evaluation (response rate = 100%), a record high since I started teaching this course!

In **Spring 2024**, I taught _CHE 3113 - Rate Operations II_ for the third time. I received an overall teaching evaluation score of 4.40 out of 5 ("Excellent" rating) on end-of-semester course evaluation (response rate = 45%).

In **Fall 2023**, I taught _CHE 4124 - Chemical Engineering Design I_ for the second time, with [Prof. Clint Aichele](https://ceat.okstate.edu/che/faculty-staff/clint-aichele.html). I received an overall teaching evaluation score of 4.4 out of 5. In the Phillips 66 Design Project competition, we explored ways to maximize ultra-low-sulur diesel production from the sweet gas oil to improve overall process economics of hydrotreating process.

In **Spring 2023**, I taught _CHE 3113 - Rate Operations II_ for the second time. I received an overall teaching evaluation score of 4.38 out of 5 ("Excellent" rating) on end-of-semester course evaluation (response rate = 95%).

In **Fall 2022**, I taught _CHE 2581 - Chemical Engineering Sophomore Seminar_ with [Prof. Sundar Madihally](https://ceat.okstate.edu/che/faculty-staff/sundar-madihally.html). In this course, we invited industrial and faculty speakers to introduce the chemical engineering profession and different career paths chemical engineers can pursue to sophomores. We also organized and presented various useful resources at OSU (e.g., services in academic tutoring, career development, and mental health and wellness) to sophomore students, taught them practical skills (e.g., resume writing, lab report writing and formatting, career fair and interview prepraration), and introduced needed concepts and qualities for becoming a successful chemical engineer (e.g., engineering ethics, professionalism, chemical process safety). I received an overall teaching evaluation score of 4.71 out of 5 ("Excellent" rating) on end-of-semester course evaluation (response rate = 91%).

In **Spring 2022**, I restructured and taught a brand new _CHE 3113 - Rate Operations II_. This was my first time teaching solo, and I revamped the course structure and materials to synergistically integrate it with chemical reaction engineering and senior design. I received an overall teaching evaluation score of 4.04 out of 5 ("Good" rating: 3.75-4.25) on end-of-semester course evaluation (response rate = 96%). I also presented a poster during the [2022 ASEE/AIChE Summer School for Engineering Faculty](https://www.aiche.org/conferences/faculty-chemical-engineering-summer-school/2022) to highlight this brand new structure and methodology to teach undergraduate separations course by helping students develop a systematic and comprehensive perspective on the subject matter.

In **Fall 2021**, I co-taught _CHE 4124 - Chemical Engineering Design I_ along with [Prof. Josh Ramsey](https://ceat.okstate.edu/che/faculty-staff/josh-ramsey.html) and [Prof. Shohreh Hemmati](https://ceat.okstate.edu/che/faculty-staff/shohreh-hemmati.html). I received an overall score of 4.47 out of 5 ("Excellent" rating: >4.25/5) on end-of-semester course evaluation (response rate = 93%).
