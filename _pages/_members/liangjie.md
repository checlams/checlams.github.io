I have been a graduate student in Prof. Jiang's [Computational Laboratory for Advanced Manufacturing & Sustainability (CLAMS)](https://ceat.okstate.edu/che/research/clams/) group at Oklahoma State University since Fall 2025, pursuing a Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering. My current research focuses on the integration of data-driven methods with chemical engineering principles to optimize sustainable manufacturing processes and material design. I bring a multidisciplinary background in statistics, data science, and machine learning, gained through my M.S. in Statistics from UC Davis and B.S. in Data Science from Fudan University.
