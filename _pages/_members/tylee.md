I worked as an Undergraduate Researcher at CLAMS from Spring 2023 to Spring 2025. I am now a PhD student in chemical engineering at Texas A&M University. During my time at OSU, I worked on electrification of separation units for the steam cracking process. I received several recognitions and awards, including the [CEAT Undergraduate Research Scholarship](https://ceat.okstate.edu/scholarships/scholar-programs/undergraduate-research-scholars-program.html), [Outstanding Chemical Engineering Senior Award, and the R.N. Maddox Chemical Engineering Senior Design Contest Award](https://ceat.okstate.edu/announcements/che/2025/che_2025_banquets_recap.html). I was also part of the team who won the [First Place for the Best Applications of Inherently Safer Design (Ted Ventrone, Ephraim Scheier & Walt Silowska Award) in 2025 AIChE Design Competition](https://news.okstate.edu/articles/engineering-architecture-technology/2025/che_student_design_teams_finish_first_in_aiche_design_contest.html).
