    abstract = {Root-zone soil moisture monitoring is essential for precision agriculture, smart irrigation, and drought prevention. Modeling the spatiotemporal water flow dynamics in soil is typically achieved by solving a hydrological model, such as the Richards equation which is a highly nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE). In this paper, we present a novel data-facilitated numerical method for solving the mixed-form Richards equation. This numerical method, which we call the D-GRW (Data-facilitated global Random Walk) method, synergistically integrates adaptive linearization scheme, neural networks, and global random walk in a finite volume discretization framework to produce accurate numerical solutions of the Richards equation with guaranteed convergence under reasonable assumptions. Through three illustrative examples, we demonstrate and discuss the superior accuracy and mass conservation performance of our D-GRW method and compare it with benchmark numerical methods and commercial solver.},

    abstract = {Modern industrial processes are continuously monitored by a large number of sensors. Despite hav-ing access to large volumes of historical and online sensor data, industrial practitioners still face challenges in the era of Industry 4.0 in effectively utilizing them to perform online process monitor-ing and fast fault detection and diagnosis. To target these challenges, in this work, we present a novel framework named “FARM” for Fast, Accurate, and Robust online process Monitoring. FARM is a holistic monitoring framework that integrates (a) advanced multivariate statistical process control (SPC) for fast anomaly detection of nonparametric, heterogeneous data streams, and (b) modified support vector machine (SVM) for accurate and robust fault classification. Unlike existing general-purpose process monitoring frameworks, FARM’s unique hierarchical architecture decomposes pro-cess monitoring into two fault detection and diagnosis, each of which is conducted by targeted al-gorithms. Here, we test and validate the performance of our FARM monitoring framework on Ten-nessee Eastman Process (TEP) benchmark dataset. We show that SPC achieves faster fault de-tection speed at a lower false alarm rate compared to state-of-the-art benchmark fault detection methods. In terms of fault classification diagnosis, we show that our modified SVM algorithm suc-cessfully classifies 17 out of 20 of the fault scenarios present in the TEP dataset. Compared with the results of standard SVM trained directly on the original dataset, our modified SVM improves the fault classification accuracy significantly.},

    abstract = {Soil moisture is a crucial hydrological state variable that has significant importance to the global environment and agriculture. Precise monitoring of soil moisture in crop fields is critical to reducing agricultural drought and improving crop yield. In-situ soil moisture sensors, which are buried at pre-determined depths and distributed across the field, are promising solutions for monitoring soil moisture. However, high-density sensor deployment is neither economically feasible nor practical. Thus, to achieve a higher spatial resolution of soil moisture dynamics using a limited number of sensors, we integrate a physics-based agro-hydrological model based on Richards' equation in a physics-constrained deep learning framework to accurately predict soil moisture dynamics in the soil's root zone. This approach ensures that soil moisture estimates align well with sensor observations while obeying physical laws at the same time. Furthermore, to strategically identify the locations for sensor placement, we introduce a novel active learning framework that combines space-filling design and physics residual-based sampling to maximize data acquisition potential with limited sensors. Our numerical results demonstrate that integrating Physics-constrained Deep Learning (P-DL) with an active learning strategy within a unified framework--named the Physics-constrained Active Learning (P-DAL) framework--significantly improves the predictive accuracy and effectiveness of field-scale soil moisture monitoring using in-situ sensors.},
