abstract = {Highly crystalline exfoliated MFI-nanosheets can pave the way for large-scale deployment of sub-500-nm zeolite membranes due to their processing and packing advantages. Exfoliated MFI-nanosheets prepared by melt compounding contain a large amount of polymer and unexfoliated particles which are detrimental to the fabrication of ultrathin zeolite membranes. Complete removal of polystyrene from the nanosheet suspension in toluene is demonstrated by centrifugation of the suspension across chlorobenzene as confirmed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) data and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images. Rate-zonal centrifugation in a nonlinear density gradient fractionated exfoliated MFI-nanosheets from unexfoliated particles. The purified nanosheets were highly crystalline as indicated by high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) and electron diffraction (ED). Coating of purified MFI-nanosheets on a smooth α-alumina support, fabricated by filtration of α-alumina suspension, led to a compact, b-oriented, 80-nm-thick film. A mild hydrothermal treatment of the film led to a 200-nm-thick membrane, which demonstrated molecular sieving properties.},

abstract = {Heat and mass integration to consolidate distillation columns in a multicomponent distillation configuration can lead to a number of new energy efficient and cost-effective configurations. In this work, a powerful and simple-to-use fact about heat and mass integration is identified. The newly developed heat and mass integrated configurations, which we call as HMP configurations, involve first introducing thermal couplings to all intermediate transfer streams, followed by consolidating columns associated with a lighter pure product reboiler and a heavier pure product condenser. A systematic method of enumerating all HMP configurations is introduced. The energy savings of HMP configurations is compared with the well-known fully thermally coupled (FTC) configurations. HMP configurations can have very similar and sometimes even the same minimum total vapor duty requirement as the FTC configuration is demonstrated, while using far less number of column sections, intermediate transfer streams, and thermal couplings than the FTC configurations.},

Distillation, which is one of the most important separation technologies in the chemical industry, is therefore a crucial component in PI. Here, we discuss two aspects of PI in multicomponent distillation: 1) Performing simultaneous heat and mass integration among thermally coupled distillation columns to reduce the number of columns and heat duty requirement; and 2) Conducting any thermally coupled distillation in only a single column shell using a dividing wall column that is fully operable. Through examples, we show that synergistic use of both strategies leads to the design of compact, easy-to-operate, energy efficient and cost effective multicomponent distillation systems.},

Distillation, the most commonly used separation technique in the chemical industry, is a crucial component of PI. Here, we systematically discuss the following aspects of PI in non-azeotropic multicomponent distillation: (1) Introducing thermal couplings to eliminate intermediate reboilers and condensers to save energy and capital cost; (2) Improving operability of thermally coupled columns by means of eliminating vapor streams in thermal couplings with only liquid transfers or column section rearrangement; (3) Enabling double and multi-effect distillation of thermally coupled configurations to further reduce heat duty; (4) Performing simultaneous heat and mass integration among thermally coupled columns to reduce the number of columns and heat duty; and (5) Conducting any thermally coupled distillation in n-product streams using 1 to n−2 column shells with operable novel dividing wall columns. We demonstrate these aspects of PI through examples to illustrate how they lead to compact, easy-to-operate, energy efficient and cost effective multicomponent distillation system designs.},

This new framework extends the Global Minimization Algorithm (GMA) previously introduced by Nallasivam et al. (2016); and we refer to the new framework as the Global Minimization Algorithm for Cost (GMAC). GMAC guarantees global optimality by formulating a nonlinear program (NLP) for each and every distillation configuration in the search space and solving it using global optimization solvers. The case study presented in this work not only demonstrates the need for developing such an algorithm, but also shows the flexibility and effectiveness of GMAC, which enables process engineers to design and retrofit energy efficient and cost-effective distillation configurations.},

abstract = {The operating cost of a multicomponent distillation system comprises two major aspects: the overall heat duty requirement and the temperature levels at which the heat duties are generated and rejected. The second aspect, often measured by the thermodynamic efficiency of the distillation system, can be quantified by its total exergy loss. In this article, we introduce a global optimization framework for determining the minimum total exergy loss required to distill any ideal or near-ideal multicomponent mixture using a sequence of columns. Desired configurations identified by this new framework tend to use milder-temperature reboilers and condensers and are thus attractive for applications such as heat pump assisted distillation. Through a case study of shale gas separations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework and present various useful physical insights for designing energy efficient distillation systems.},

journal={Le Scientifique},

number={1},
pages = {17-25},
abstract = {Chemical, pharmaceutical, and agrochemical industries frequently face the challenge of separating multicomponent mixtures exhibiting one or more azeotropes using distillation. The minimum reflux ratio of a distillation column is directly related to its energy consumption and capital cost. Thus, it is a key parameter for distillation systems design, operation, and comparison. Despite its great scientific significance and practical importance, this problem remains an open challenge to researchers and industrial practitioners due to the highly nonideal nature of azeotropic systems. In this work, we present a simple and easy-to-use shortcut method to analytically calculate the minimum reflux ratio for a broad class of multicomponent homogeneous azeotropic mixture separations. Through an illustrative example, we demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of our new ideal multicomponent distillation turns out to be a special case of this generalized method. Compared with existing techniques, this method does not involve any rigorous tray-by-tray calculation and is iteration free. Therefore, it can be easily incorporated into a global optimization framework that enables industrial practitioners to, for the first time, quickly synthesize energy-efficient and cost-effective multicomponent azeotropic distillation systems and determine their optimal operating conditions.},

The classic McCabe-Thiele or Underwood method is a special case of this general approach. Compared with existing techniques, this method does not involve any rigorous tray-by-tray calculation, nor does it require guessing of key components. In this first part of the series, we present the mathematical model for a general MFMP column, derive constraints for feasible separation and minimum reflux condition, discuss their geometric interpretations, and present an illustrative example to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

abstract = {Modeling and predicting soil moisture is essential for precision agriculture, smart irrigation, and drought prevention. In this work, we introduce a novel data-driven random walk (DRW) approach to solve $n$-dimensional Richards equation, a complex partial differential equation that characterizes water flow dynamics in soil. This advanced computational framework integrates multiple features, including finite volume discretization, adaptive L-scheme, multi-layer neural networks, and the concept of random walk to enable fast and accurate numerical solution of the Richards equation. Through an illustrative example, we demonstrate the accuracy and attractiveness of this novel approach. In particular, we show that our DRW approach can implicitly capture the underlying physical relationships among soil moisture content, pressure head, and flux, which will enable more accurate characterization of water flow dynamics.},
