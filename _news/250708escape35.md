Our group had a strong presence in the [35th European Symposium on Computer Aided Process Engineering (ESCAPE)](https://escape35-belgium.eu/) held at KU Leuven, Belgium. We gave three oral talks (including one keynote talk) and one poster presentation on our latest research. Papers published in this conference can be found [here]({{'publications/' | relative_url}}).
