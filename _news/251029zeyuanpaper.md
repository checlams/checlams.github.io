Our paper entitled "[MP-FVM: Enhancing Finite Volume Method for Water Infiltration Modeling in Unsaturated Soils via Message-passing Encoder-decoder Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02806)" is accepted for publication in [Computers and Geotechnics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/computers-and-geotechnics), one of the premier journals in civil/environmental engineering and geotechnics. This paper presents a novel data-driven numerical scheme for solving n-dimensional Richards equation with superior accuracy and stability.
