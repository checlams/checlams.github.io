We are excited to welcome two new graduate students, Alireza Miraliakbar and Mehrdad Zomorodiyan (co-advised by [Prof. Yu Feng](https://www.cbbl-okstate.com/about-dr-yu-feng-pi)) to CLAMS! Prior to their arrival, Alireza received his M.S. degree in Chemical Engineering from University of Tehran in Iran. Meanwhile, Mehrdad completed his M.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering at OSU, where he worked with [Prof. Omer San](https://experts.okstate.edu/osan) at the [CFDLab](https://www.cfdlab.org). Upon joining CLAMS, Mehrdad will develop machine learning methods to solve complex CFD problems in advanced manufacturing and healthcare, and Alireza will work on optimal control of chemical and biochemical processes using reinforcement learning.
