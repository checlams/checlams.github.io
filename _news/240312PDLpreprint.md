A preprint on physics-constrained active learning for soil moisture estimation and optimal sensor placement is available [here]({{'preprints/' | relative_url}}). This is a collaborative work with [Prof. Bing Yao](https://ise.utk.edu/people/bing-yao-phd/) from University of Tennessee, Knoxville and [Prof. Jianxin Xie](https://datascience.virginia.edu/people/jianxin-xie) from University of Virginia.
