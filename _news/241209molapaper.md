We are excited to share our recent publication in Processes entitled "[MOLA: Enhancing Industrial Process Monitoring Using a Multi-Block Orthogonal Long Short-Term Memory Autoencoder](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/12/12/2824)" as part of the Special Issue: Process Modeling, Simulation, and Optimization in Chemical Engineering. This work was led by Fangyuan Ma, a visiting scholar from Beijing University of Chemical Technology (BUCT). Collaborators include researchers from BUCT and Louisiana State University.
