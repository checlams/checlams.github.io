Our group has been very productive in 2025, publishing [7 preprints]({{'preprints/' | relative_url}}) so far that are under review or accepted. Topics include supply chain optimization, microgrid operation optimization, water infiltration modeling, Bayesian approach for inverse problems, multicomponent distillation optimization, process monitoring and analytics, and more.
