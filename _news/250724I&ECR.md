We are excited to share our recent publication in Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research entitled "[Harnessing Process Knowledge via Soft Sensing for Accurate Online Monitoring: A Study on the Dow Data Challenge Problem](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.iecr.5c01644)". This paper presents a lightweight, effective process monitoring framework that synergistically incorporates process knowledge into online monitoring.
